title: "Social Disparities of Sea Level Rise in Miami?"

subtitle: Final Project GEO 503

# Introduction
For this final project, I am interested in exploring ways in which projected impacts of sea level rise (under different scenarios) along the US coast may demonstrate disparities in affected demographic groups. Depending on data availability and level of resolution, I am considering focusing on either the Miami metropolitan area or Puerto Rico. My inspiration for this project came from reading an article about how rising sea levels and flooding in Atlantic City is disproportionately affecting low-income residents, and the suggestion that this may be the case in other coastal US cities (Upton, 2017). Additionally, we have seen tremendous damage from hurricanes in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico in the past few weeks. The increasing frequency of strong hurricanes likely relates to climate change, and this will couple with rising sea levels in causing further damage to coasts and islands.


# Materials and methods

Narrative and most code will go here.  Describe what you are doing and show how to do it (with code).

You can do bullets like this:

* The first most important thing
* The second most important thing
* The third most important thing

You can do numbers like this:

1. The first most important thing
2. The second most important thing
3. The third most important thing

See [http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) for all the amazing things you can do.


Here's my first code chunk.
```{r}
1+2
```

Load any required packages in a code chunk (you may need to install some packages):

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(maps)
library(spocc)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache=TRUE)  # cache the results for quick compiling
```


We are going to use the `occ()` function to download _occurrence_ records for the American robin (_Turdus migratorius_) from the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility](gbif.org).

```{r, warning=F} 
## define which species to query
sp='Turdus migratorius'

## run the query and convert to data.frame()
d = occ(query=sp, from='ebird',limit = 100) %>% occ2df()
```
This can take a few seconds.

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=3, fig.cap="Map illustrating the known occurrence locations"}
# Load coastline
map=map_data("world")

ggplot(d,aes(x=longitude,y=latitude))+
  geom_polygon(aes(x=long,y=lat,group=group),data=map)+
  geom_point(col="red")+
  coord_equal()
```


# Results

```{r}
8+8
```


Show tables, plots, etc. and describe them.

# Conclusions

What have you learned?  Are there any broader implications?
